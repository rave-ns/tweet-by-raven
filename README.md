A Telegram bot that allows users to interact with Twitter directly from Telegram. Post tweets, read profiles, and search for content without leaving Telegram.

## Features

* üê¶ **Post Tweets**: Create and publish tweets directly from Telegram
* üìñ **Read Tweets**: View the latest tweets from any public Twitter profile
* üîç **Search Twitter**: Find tweets that match specific keywords
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Account Management**: Securely connect your Twitter account through API credentials
* üîê **Secure Storage**: All API keys are stored securely in MongoDB

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Twitter API

Twitter (now X) requires a developer account with an appropriate subscription plan to use their API:

* **Free Tier**: Very limited API calls per month
* **Basic Tier** ($100/month): Up to 10,000 tweets/month, 50,000 reads/month
* **Pro Tier** ($5,000/month): Higher limits for serious applications

**This bot requires users to have their own Twitter Developer credentials**, which means each user needs to register for their own Twitter Developer account and create an app to get API credentials. More information can be found at [Twitter's Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products).
